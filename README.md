### **Stash is a self-hosted webapp written in Go which organizes and serves your movie.**

* Stash gathers information about videos in your collection from the internet, and is extensible through the use of community-built plugins for a large number of content producers and sites.
* Stash supports a wide variety of both video and image formats.
* You can tag videos and find them later.
* Stash provides statistics about performers, tags, studios and more.

You can [watch a SFW demo video](https://vimeo.com/545323354) to see it in action.

For further information you can [read the in-app manual](ui/v2.5/src/docs/en).

## Getting Started
Run the executable (double click the exe on windows or run `./stash-osx` / `./stash-linux` from the terminal on macOS / Linux) to get started.

*Note for Windows users:* Running the app might present a security prompt since the binary isn't yet signed.  Bypass this by clicking "more info" and then the "run anyway" button.

#### FFMPEG
Stash requires ffmpeg. If you don't have it installed, Stash will download a copy for you. It is recommended that Linux users install `ffmpeg` from their distro's package manager.

# Usage

## Quickstart Guide
Download and run Stash. It will prompt you for some configuration options and a directory to index (you can also do this step afterward)

**If you'd like to automatically retrieve and organize information about your entire library,**  You will need to download some [scrapers](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/tree/develop/ui/v2.5/src/docs/en/Scraping.md). The Stash community has developed scrapers for many popular data sources which can be downloaded and installed from [this repository](https://github.com/stashapp/CommunityScrapers).

The simplest way to tag a large number of files is by using the [Tagger](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/blob/develop/ui/v2.5/src/docs/en/Tagger.md) which uses filename keywords to help identify the file and pull in scene and performer information from our stash-box database. Note that this data source is not comprehensive and you may need to use the scrapers to identify some of your media.
